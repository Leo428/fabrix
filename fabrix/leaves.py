"""Leaf factories: each returns ``leaf(q, qd, params) -> Spec`` in configuration space.

Every leaf follows one pattern: define a **desired acceleration** ``a_des`` and a **priority
metric** ``M``, and emit force ``f = -M @ a_des`` so the leaf's *isolated* acceleration is
exactly ``a_des`` while ``M`` sets how strongly the leaf wins the metric-weighted combination.
This is the RMP/fabric design: the task attractor carries a large metric so it dominates in the
task directions, while posture/damping act where the task metric is small (the nullspace) —
so redundancy is resolved without biasing the end-effector equilibrium.

Task-space leaves (``attractor``) are pulled back to configuration space; config-space leaves
(``posture``, ``config_damping``) are identity-map leaves returned directly. M1 leaves are
*forced* (metric + potential-gradient + damping); HD2 geometries + energization arrive in M2.
Gains are baked at construction (mink-style); ``params.target``/``params.q_default`` are traced.
